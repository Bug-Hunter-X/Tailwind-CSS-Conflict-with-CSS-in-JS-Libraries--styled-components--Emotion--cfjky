# Tailwind CSS Conflict with CSS-in-JS Libraries

This repository demonstrates a common issue when integrating Tailwind CSS with CSS-in-JS solutions such as `styled-components` or `Emotion`. The conflict arises from the dynamic nature of CSS-in-JS, which can interfere with Tailwind's static class application.

## Problem

When using both Tailwind and a CSS-in-JS library, unexpected styling behavior can occur. This is because both try to style the same element, leading to unpredictable overrides based on specificity and execution order.  This can manifest as classes not applying, styles being overridden, or other unpredictable styling issues.

## Solution

The most effective solution is to carefully manage the CSS specificity and avoid direct conflicts.  This often involves using appropriate CSS selectors, ensuring proper order in your CSS, or refactoring to favor one styling approach over the other.  This repository demonstrates how to refactor to isolate Tailwind from CSS-in-JS components.
