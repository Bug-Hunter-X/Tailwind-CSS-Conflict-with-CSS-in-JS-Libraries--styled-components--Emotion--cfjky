To resolve the conflict, you need to carefully manage the styling to prevent conflicts.  One approach is to isolate Tailwind's styles from CSS-in-JS styles. For instance, you could wrap your Tailwind-styled elements in a container that isolates the styles.

```javascript
const MyComponent = styled.div`
  /* Keep any CSS-in-JS styles here */
`;

const TailwindWrapper = styled.div`
  /*No styles here*/
`;

const App = () => {
  return (
    <MyComponent>
      <TailwindWrapper>
        <div className="bg-blue-500 p-4">
          This div is styled by Tailwind
        </div>
      </TailwindWrapper>
    </MyComponent>
  );
};
```

Another option is to leverage Tailwind's `@layer` directives to manage the order of your CSS.  For very complex projects, consider sticking with one approach either entirely using Tailwind or entirely using CSS-in-JS and avoid mixing them unless necessary.
